                    <h2>Research Topic & Significance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Extreme heat events have emerged as one of the most pressing climate-related hazards in the United States, with impacts that span public health, infrastructure, and long-term climate resilience. 
                        This project focuses on analyzing extreme heat events across the country to understand how these events vary geographically and how their frequency and intensity have changed over time. 
                        As temperatures rise and heat waves become more common, identifying where and when extreme heat occurs is essential for preparing communities and protecting vulnerable populations. 
                        Historical climate data provides a powerful lens for examining long-term patterns, revealing whether extreme heat days are becoming more frequent, more intense, or more geographically widespread. 
                        Understanding these trends is not only scientifically important but also socially and economically significant, as extreme heat is responsible for more weather-related fatalities in the U.S. than hurricanes, floods, or tornadoes. 
                        By studying spatial and temporal patterns, this research contributes to broader efforts to strengthen climate resilience and inform adaptation strategies. 
                        The project also aims to explore how extreme heat varies seasonally, how urban and rural regions differ in exposure, and whether certain states or climate zones are disproportionately affected. 
                        These insights can help identify emerging hotspots of heat risk and guide targeted interventions. 
                        Ultimately, this research benefits public health agencies, policymakers, emergency managers, and communities seeking to understand and respond to the growing threat of extreme heat. 
                        Through a data-driven approach, the project highlights the importance of using historical climate patterns to anticipate future risks and support proactive decision-making.

                        Extreme heat affects a wide range of stakeholders, making this research relevant across multiple sectors and communities. 
                        Public health agencies rely on accurate assessments of heat exposure to prepare hospitals and emergency departments for increases in heat-related illnesses. 
                        Local governments and emergency managers must coordinate cooling centers, hydration stations, and public communication strategies to protect residents during dangerous heat events. 
                        Energy providers face significant challenges as heat waves increase electricity demand, strain power grids, and elevate the risk of outages. 
                        Agricultural workers, farmers, and outdoor laborers are particularly vulnerable, as prolonged exposure to high temperatures can reduce productivity and increase the risk of heat stress. 
                        Urban planners and environmental justice advocates also have a stake in understanding extreme heat patterns, as low-income neighborhoods and communities of color often experience higher temperatures due to the urban heat island effect. 
                        Insurance companies and federal agencies such as FEMA depend on climate-risk assessments to allocate resources and evaluate disaster declarations. 
                        Even private industries—such as construction, transportation, and tourism—must adapt operations during periods of extreme heat. 
                        The real-world implications of this research extend beyond academic analysis, influencing decisions that affect health, safety, and economic stability. 
                        By identifying which regions experience the highest number of extreme heat events and how these patterns evolve, the project provides actionable insights for stakeholders across the country.

                    <h2>Existing Solutions & Gaps</h2>
                    <p>
                        Several existing systems attempt to monitor or predict extreme heat, but each has limitations that create opportunities for improvement. 
                        The National Weather Service issues heat advisories and warnings, yet these alerts are typically short-term and do not provide insight into long-term trends or regional disparities. 
                        FEMA's disaster declarations offer information about heat-related emergencies, but these declarations are influenced by political and economic factors, which can lead to inconsistent reporting across states. 
                        The CDC's heat-related illness datasets provide valuable health outcome data, but they do not directly measure exposure conditions or capture the full spectrum of heat events. 
                        Academic research has produced heat vulnerability indices and climate risk maps, but many rely on coarse spatial resolution or outdated climate baselines that may not reflect recent warming trends. 
                        Machine learning models have been used in some studies to predict heat events, but these models often focus on individual cities rather than nationwide patterns. 
                        Additionally, many existing approaches fail to integrate multiple data sources—such as climate variables, socioeconomic indicators, and disaster impacts—into a unified analytical framework. 
                        These gaps highlight the need for a comprehensive, data-driven analysis that examines extreme heat across the entire United States and explores both spatial and temporal dimensions. 
                        By addressing these limitations, this project contributes to a more complete understanding of extreme heat and its drivers.

                    <h2>Blueprint for Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project will utilize a multi-step approach to analyze extreme heat events across the United States, guided directly by our research questions about frequency, geography, seasonality, and long-term trends. 
                        We will begin by acquiring and preprocessing historical climate data from NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and other publicly available NOAA datasets that provide daily maximum temperature records across multiple decades. 
                        Using these datasets, we will define extreme heat days based on established statistical thresholds—such as the 95th percentile of historical temperatures—to create a standardized measure that can be compared across regions and time periods. 
                        This foundation will allow us to investigate how the frequency of extreme heat days has changed nationally, which regions experience the highest number of events, and whether certain states or climate zones are disproportionately affected. 
                        After constructing this dataset, we will conduct exploratory data analysis to examine seasonal variability, identify long-term trends in heat intensity, and compare patterns between urban and rural areas. 
                        These analyses will help us answer questions about how extreme heat varies across geographic contexts and whether specific environmental or demographic factors contribute to elevated risk. 
                        By grounding our analysis in robust climate data, this phase ensures that our findings are both scientifically meaningful and directly tied to our research questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Building on the exploratory phase, we will use geospatial visualization techniques to map extreme heat hotspots and evaluate how these patterns relate to urbanization, socioeconomic vulnerability, and FEMA disaster declarations. 
                        This step will allow us to compare years with major heat-related disaster declarations to years without them, addressing our question about how extreme heat translates into real-world impacts. 
                        We will also examine environmental and geographic factors—such as humidity, elevation, land-surface temperature, and regional climate classifications—to determine which variables are most strongly associated with extreme heat days. 
                        In the final stage of the project, we will apply statistical methods and machine learning models to evaluate whether historical weather patterns can be used to estimate the likelihood of future extreme heat events in specific regions. 
                        These models will also help us identify potential precursors or early indicators that precede periods of unusually high heat activity. 
                        By integrating multiple datasets and analytical techniques, the project will culminate in a series of visualizations and insights that directly address our research questions and inform stakeholders about where and when extreme heat is most likely to occur. 
                        Ultimately, this blueprint ensures a coherent, data-driven approach that connects descriptive analysis, predictive modeling, and practical relevance in understanding extreme heat across the United States.

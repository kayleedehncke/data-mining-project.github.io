                    <h2>Proposal Overview</h2>

                    <h3>Research Topic</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project focuses on analyzing extreme heat events across the United States to better
                        understand how these events vary across geographic regions and change over time. By examining
                        historical temperature patterns, the project aims to identify spatial and temporal trends
                        in extreme heat and their broader implications for public health and climate resilience.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Scope</h3>
                    <p>
                        The scope of this project includes a nationwide analysis of historical extreme temperature
                        conditions across the United States. The analysis emphasizes regional variation and
                        long-term trends while remaining focused on descriptive and comparative patterns present
                        in observed climate data.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        The primary goal of this project is to identify where and when extreme heat events occur
                        most frequently across the United States. Additional goals include comparing regional
                        exposure to extreme heat, exploring associations between heat events and disaster-related
                        impacts, and examining patterns that may indicate increased risk of extreme temperature days.
